# Stacktrace
A sample and hold module with 8 stack frames. When the Push gate is triggered, the In input is sampled and added to the stack. Each additional push pushes an additional value onto the stack. Pop removes a value from the top of the stack. The value that is output is the value at the top of the stack, and is 0 when the stack is empty.
